It's a casual game with no end and no goal, so a matter of balance probably won't apply here.

For what the game is the timing seemed to be alright, though it is sometimes hard to know when you can activate certain things.

The game is very casual and the mechanics are simple, for the overall theme of the game it seemed to be on the same page.

For a few minutes I was intrigued and watching it unfold was entertaining, but I lost interest fairly quickly.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
