**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> The objective of the game was said up front, but the rules of the game mechanics as a whole were something I had to figure out.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> There were a few platforms that you were not even able to get to and served no purpose.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> Overall I would say it was surprisingly balanced, there were save points throughout the map that let you respawn close to where you died.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> The timing was rather slow. You were given a task and then just sent out to find everything without much help. If you know where everything is it might take you just a few minutes, but otherwise you could be wandering around blindly for far too long for this type of game.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> The mechanics were very simple and a bit rough, especially the movement. The platforming and avoiding obstacles was about what you would expect, but nothing more. Overall they went well enough together, but nothing made the mechanics memorable.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> No. The mechanics were lackluster, the narrative wasn't really there, and there was not much leading the player on, the game flow was simply not good!

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> The frame rate would drop randomly as low as around 10 FPS. The jumping had lag from time to time, there seemed to be no reason, not even the frame rate drops, for it or a way to get around it. There were also some collision issues were the plants would hit you outside of their visual range, like there collisions stretched outside of the art on occasions.
