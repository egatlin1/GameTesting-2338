**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> There were no instructions at any point in my playthrough, not even basic controls. Once I did figure out the controls they felt off from what I would have expected.

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> It was barely a game as is, It didn't have mucn to it but I don't think it would be able to do without anything else.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> It is definitely not balanced The target audience is hard to say, probably people that don't mind grinding for potentially hours on end.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> It was far too slow paced for this style game. Passing each level took far longer than it should have.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> Although a little rough I thought, the over all theme and mechanics of the gameplay did seem to go together pretty well.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> No. It was far too slow paced and the controls were not intuitive

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> There didn't seem to be any bugs from what I played. I did not particularly like the systems, but they all seemed to work as intended.
