B+ A wonderful nostalgia trip back to 90s

## Summary
Although not very well known today amungst younger gamers, Myst was one of the biggest games to come out in the early 90s. Made by the Miller brothers, Myst is the first game in a very long story line and is a truly unique game boasting a strange and well thought out world littered with brilliant puzzles. Sadly a lot of aspects of this game don't translate too terribly well in to the game market these days, but if you are looking for a nostalgia trip then Myst is the game for you.

The setting for Myst is genuinely one of the best and most creative I have seen in a game. The look alone is something special. Graphics back in the 90s were not exactly up to todays standards, but the way the developers created the world with images and live actors gives it a sense of life that not many other games back then could do. Without going too far into the lore, and you easily could spend pages getting into it, the actual game world of Myst is based around the idea of books. Books in this game aren't just pages for reading like we use them, but they actually contain worlds and events that you as the player will get to go and explore and experience. At the start of the game you find one of these books called "Myst" and opening that book brings you into that world. From there you find a couple other books, a red and a blue one, and the story lays out in front of you from these two books.

These books lead you to explore the worlds and encourage you to solve the many puzzles in them. And this is where Myst shines brightest. The puzzles in this game are extremely varried and each one is unique and will require some real thinking on the part of the player. Some are much easier puzzles meant to start the player out and get them in the right mood. It also does something that not a lot of people might like, but personally I did, and that is letting you the player see much harder and more complicated puzzles before it is time to solve them. From the start of the game the world is open to you, you are free to walk, or click as it were, around the world and see everything it has to offer. Which is an aspect that I liked, though some people did complain that it was a little hard to know where to go or what puzzle to solve next.

That I partly attribute to it being in the earlier days of games. Back in the 90s not everything was fixed to almost a science as it is today and developers were a bit braver and more willing to try things that had not been done before, which is where Myst starts to show some of its age.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
