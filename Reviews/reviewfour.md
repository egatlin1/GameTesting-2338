B+ A unique blend of two unrelated genres that somehow mesh together perfectly

## Summary
Toodee and Topdee was a little game made for the Ludum Dare 41 gamejam in under 72 hours by dietzribi and kajnoon. The core gameplay of this game is split between two different genres, a 2D platformer and a 3D topdown puzzle game. Even though this was made by just two people and in so short a time, this little game is perfectly put together and meshes two different genres seamlessly together. 

The platforming part of this game is pretty straight forward at first. Just jump from platform to platform and get Toodee to the pretty lights at the other end of the stage. There isn't too much that you could say is special about this part of the game. It acts about how you expect, able to move left and right and jump from one platform to another. I will have more to say on this later in the review, but for now I will leave it at this.

The other genre this game is using is a topdown puzzle game. This section by itself is a bit getter handles than the platforming part of the game. In this section, you move your guy around in 8 directions, you are able to push blocks out of your way in order to get to the end of the level. Just the same as the platforming side of things, your goal is to get Topdee to the pretty light at the end of the map. Once again, this one section feels a little lackluster, that is until you bring both of these gameplay mechanics together.

Each side of the game, platforming and puzzle solving, seem a bit dull on their own, but that being said they aren't alone! And once they are meshed up together the game becomes so much more fun and interesting. When you are playing as Topdee you move through the map pushing blocks around, then when you switch to Toodee you can use those blocks as platforms to jump on. This one mechanic makes this game go from a very average platformer or puzzle game into something actually quite special! There is a level that you have to move blocks around so that Toodee can go and grab a key to unlock an area that Topdee couldn't get into, and many more puzzles that involve both characters working together to solve.

## Final Thoughts
Although I really do like this little browser-based game, there are a few things that keep it from getting an A+. As I said before, each component alone is a bit dull and nothing too special. Even though together the game is much much better, I think a little extra attention to each side would have made the feel and flow of the game a bit better for me. I also did run into a few bugs as I played. I'm not sure if it is something that only I encountered or not, but not being able to pick up at the last level I played from a previous play session is definitely annoying. As well as the escape key not working. However, despite those bugs, the game is still an excellent game worth a playthrough!
