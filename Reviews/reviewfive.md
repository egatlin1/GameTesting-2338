A- An interesting and surprisingly fun and strategic little game

## Summary
StrikeForce Kitty might sound like an adorable little game that's very simplistic. Well, that's not totally true. This little game is a side scroller at its core but has a surprising amount of strategy involved in making your team. For such an adorable sounding game, it has many surprises up its sleeve with different mechanics and different stages of play throughout! This game definitely has more to it than first meets the eye.

The game is of course, kind of adorable. With a name like StrikeForce Kitty it would be hard not to be. The art style fits along perfectly into the feel of the game. And for a small game like this, there is a pretty good amount of detail put into it as well! The art gives the game a bit part of it's over all feel, from the many different enemies you'll face to the ridiculous amount of loot there is to collect, and of course a very short scene setting up the "story". This game really was well thought out and well put together from start to finish!

So sure it is all nice and pretty, but is it fun? In a word, yes! If you like side scrollers then you should love this. It has of course the expected jumping mechanics of most side scrollers, jumping from platform to platform as you move across the map. But it also has much more to offer as well! You are able to customize your team, which at first might sound a little out of place for a game like this, but it surprisingly adds a new level of strategy once you delve into it! There are also different stages you must fight your way through and boss battle along the way as you level up your team and deck them out with new gear.

## Final Thoughts
Sadly, it all can't be good news. I did run into a small bug here and there during my play time, but those were small enough that they are forgivable. If not for those bugs I would have given it an A+, but even so this game is worth the time investment. It's simple and something you can play on and off as you have a free minute or two. I love everything about it and completely recommend checking it out if you are into the side scroller genre!
