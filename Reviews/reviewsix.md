A Almost as perfect of a platformer game as you can find

## Summary
Deep Down is an adorable and super fun browser platformer. It is exactly what you would want from this genre, with very good controls, good level design, and great music!  Everything about this game speaks of polish and care, and it was hard to put it down to write this review.

As you would probably expect from this type of game, it involves a lot of jumping. But I feel like this game nails it better than most, giving you variable jump height depending on how long you hold down the button, and absolutely no lag at all, which I find to be rare on browser games. On top of that, the overall controls of the character are perfect! Even the camera is very smooth, giving a little lag when you move and not being too jitter like most 2d games. From the jumping of course to the sides to side movements, all perfectly tuned in to the platforming genre. 

On top of just good controls, the level design is very good as well. Starting off easier and getting harder as the levels go. You are introduced to each mechanic at a pretty good pace so that you have time to learn and adjust to them. And there are a lot of them to go around, from the typical jumping platform to platform and avoiding spikes, but it also has more interesting mechanics like blocks that push you upwards, disappearing platforms and more! As weird as it might be to say, even the dying is good! There is no scene loading, and no stop to the great music, the camera moves back to start, and you get another chance to try again, all as smooth as can be!

Speaking of the music, it’s not something I normally would point out in this type of game, but I really liked it! It fit the theme of the game perfectly and was implemented just as well. Upon death there are no hiccups in it at all, the songs just keep going. And some of the harder levels have more intense music playing to give you an extra sence of urgency. Now I know this might all sound standard for any game, but to be done this well in a simple browser-based game is something of note to be sure!


## Final Thoughts
It really is a gem of a game as simple as it is. I absolutely did enjoy it as much as the rest of my review shows, though it wasn’t quite a perfect game. I did love the level design and thought it was well done, I think there are a few times when the difficulty curve is a bit too much at one time. That being said, I still kept at it and was able to pass that point, but it took a lot more deaths that it probably should have just going from one level to another.
