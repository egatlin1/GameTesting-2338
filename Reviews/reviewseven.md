## Summary
I sat down to play this mouthful of a game for maybe an hour, but here I am finally reviewing this after two and a half hours. Super Crazy Guitar Maniac Duluxe 4 is a total nostalgia trip, and just genuinely a fun game! There is just so much going on in this game and seriously a lot to do for just a simple flash game that it blows me away. The music is great, the mechanics are solid, and the art is truly something that stands out! There's just something about this game that caught my attention and wouldn't let go.

For starters, this is a music based game, so the music is what will immediately catch your attention. It is a lot higher quality than I ever would have expected from a flash game, and it also fit the theme perfectly on top of that. This game has a surprising 16 songs that you can play on two difficulties. That's easily enough time to keep you playing for a couple hours, or more if you aren't as skilled at it like myself. On top of just the songs, there's so much more to be offered by this small game.

And with great music you will need great instruments to play it. Okay, so maybe there are 14 unlockable guitars which makes for a nice challenge, but they sadly don't actually change how to song feels. However, this just shows how much is in the game. On top of the guitars, there are achievements to unlock, bosses to fight, and two difficulties to play at as well. The songs themselves get harder as you go down the list, but once you are ready you can go to Pro difficulty to truly test yourself. And it really is a challenge! From Amateur to Pro is a large step in skill needed, but it doesn't punish you like most music based games.

In Super Crazy Guitar Maniac Duluxe 4, you don't automatically lose when you miss a note or too, but rather it lets you keep playing through the entire song and gives you a rank at the end. Which I appreciated since I seem to be of a lower skill level at this game. And also, unlike a lot of music games, this one has rather complicated controls making for a huge challenge as the game progresses. You start out just hitting the arrow keys, later songs introduce the number buttons 1-4, and then you have to start holding down keys while tapping others. It can be a bit overwhelming to be sure, but after some practice I was even able to get a bronze rank on a couple Pro songs, so it can be easily learned. 

## Final Thoughts
This game really is kind of special from the nostalgic past of flash games. I easily could have kept talking about it, from the visuals to the boss mechanics, to much more. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows sadly. The one thing keeping this from a perfect 10/10 is the frame rate, which can cause you to lose songs at times. I have noticed this with many other flash games, that the more complex the game the more the frame rate seems to suffer. I tried playing this on several browsers with no luck. It only happened from time to time, but when it froze up and I missed several notes because of that it was a bit of a turn of for this game to me. That being said, I love literally everything else about this game and couldn't recommend it enough!
