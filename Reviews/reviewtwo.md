A++ truly a unique one of a kind game that was made with heart and soul


## Summary
This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

It really doesn't get much more indie than a game made by just one person. Antichamber is the creation of Alexander Bruce, at the time a young programmer that had a dream. Usually games are rather easy to describe, like any COD game or games like Mirrors Edge, but this one is very unique not only in story and gameplay, but even just the look of it.

The story in Antichamber is a bit vague and hard to discribe. You are just dropped into a very strange place with little to no direction on where to go or what to do, but yet somehow that works. As you explore the level design of the game really shows itself off, from a strange black thing that you follow to small panels on the wall to read for every puzzle, it has a way of making sense without every directly leading you like most games. On top of that, the puzzles in Antichamer are easily some of the best I have ever seen in a game before. 

This is where the gameplay and story sort of merge together. The gameplay seems simple and straight forward with the basic controls you see on any game, but the puzzles add a new layer of complexity you probably arent used to. Some are as simple as move a block from point A to B, but others are strange and complex as not being able to walk through a doorway forwads or having to walk in what seems like a continuous circle only to just exit somewhere totally different than where you started to just name a couple. As the game goes on you get more tools for the puzzles and the puzzles themselves get more interesting and more difficult to solve. This game breaks apart what you would normally think to do in a game. Between the looks and oddness to the gameworld, the puzzles here are designed to make you think differently than you have been taught to think by other games.

Another truly unique aspect about this game is the look and feel of it. When Mr. Bruce was designing the looke he wanted to "make it look like it wasnt made in the Unreal Engine." and he succeded. It has a very colorful look to it, the basic world looks just simple white with black outlines on every corner, but then that is contrasted sharply bu the bight look of the puzzles. You wont find the best graphics here, but you will find something simple yet interesting as the game takes just basic colors and spashes them around the wold to lighten it up. And apart from the colors, there are many more odd things about this world that might blow your mind. From a "4D Museum" that has strange boxes that you can look into from all sides, but see something different depending on which side you look into, to the world shifting around you as you look through a window. How this is accomplished so smoothly as to make the world change without you even being away of when it happens beyond me, but it adds something so unique and awe-striking that this one aspect alone makes this game worth playing.

## Final Thoughts
If you have not played this game before I cannot reccomend it enough! Although some games have trid to copy its sense of wonder, none have ever come close to the wonder and awe you will feel when playing this bizzare and amazing game. This is easily one of my favorite games I have ever played, and the story behind it is just as interesting as the game. Even from my list of favorite games there is always something I would change about them, but this is the one exception. In my opinion this game is as close to perfect as any game is able to achieve. Now I know not everyone is huge into puzzle games, but this might be an exception to that, if for nothing else than how amazing it is as the world changes around you and makes you wonder how any of this is even possible.
