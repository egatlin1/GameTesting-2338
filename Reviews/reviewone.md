## Summary

At its core Fate is an RPG and a Dungeon Crawler. Those two genres have always gone well together and Fate is definitely no exception. Although it is not a perfect game, it does have a lot to offer for fans of the genre, from endless quests to upgrading and gaining new gear. But unlike some games of this genre, Fate is not hugely story driven but rather it relies on its gameplay to keep you playing.

The story of Fate is that you are an adventurer in the town of Grove. At the beginning of the game you are given your quest, which slightly changes from playthrough to playthrough. But that said, they are more or less the same with the only differences being what type of monster the untra-boss is and what level down in the dungeon it is on. It's not a deep wonderful story that keeps you on the edge of your seat, but rather just a reason for your player to start on their adventure.

While the story is rather lackluster, the gameplay is not. You go through the town gathering randomly generated quests that you must complete for gold, fame, and loot! After that you can enter the procedurally generated dungeon to fight monsters or go searching for a long-lost item from the quest giver, and then repeat the process. Admittedly it will eventually get a bit boring after a while, it has still stayed interesting and varied enough to keep me coming back to play. On top of the quests, there are also other things you can get up to. From gambling on items from Zim, to fishing in the river or any lakes you find in the dungeons, there is a good variety of things to keep you occupied other than just the quests.

One of the biggest things to keep you occupied, and why most people play RPG's, is of course upgrading your character and getting better gear! And this is where I feel Fate excels! At the beginning of the game you get to set the look of your player. Are you male or female, do you want a dog as a companion or a cat. The character creation section is definitely limited by todayâ€™s standards, it is still passable and gives you enough options. Passed that you get to have a lot of fun choosing what your character will be like in the game. It gives you several different ways to play, from being a mage to a swordsman, or dual wielding spears as you are surrounded by summoned wyverns. Each weapon class and each armor class are truly varied, and each class also has tons of different pieces that you can obtain as you level up. Oh, and did I mention that there is also rare gear of different level of rarity that will help you become more powerful? This aspect alone, the absolutely ridiculous amount of gear classes and gear in each class, makes this game special and worth playing!



## Final Thoughts

If you like the RPG genre and dungeon crawlers then you will love Fate. It is a simplistic game but highly addictive and is very good at keeping your attention for several hours of play. Although it might get old after a while and you will start to see patterns in the enemies and quests, overall I feel like Fate accomplished exactly what it was trying to. It is a very good RPG with an exceptional amount of varied loot and so many different play styles to pick from.
